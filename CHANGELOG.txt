# Changelog

#### 0.0.4 Tue Mar 20 19:39:06 PDT 2018

* Provide support for .rubocop.yml.  This will work once I update ide-ruby.

#### 0.0.3

* Uhh.  What did I do?  Looks like a bunch.

#### 0.0.2 Mon Nov 13 20:49:54 PST 2017

* Fix rails has_one(etc) so it gets the right parent

#### Sat Nov 11 07:59:25 PST 2017

* Outline working but buggy (double listing for parents)
* Go to definition working but lazy (have to visit a file before definitions 'known')
* Completions working in a very basic way - local scope context only
* Linter not working (not being called, NYI)
