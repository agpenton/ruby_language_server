There are various ruby and rails DSLs that are so common it makes sense to add
support for them.  Things like
attr_reader :foo
it 'should do something' do ...
describe 'some thing' do ...
task something: ... do ...

Eventually maybe it will make sense to add these things using gems.  For now,
just dump it in.
